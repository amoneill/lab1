	<p>I currently attend school at University of California, San Diego where I am receiving formal training in Cognitive Science specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I strive to be an imaginative and analytical problem solver. I am motivated by design principles, technology advances, and how people think, act, and learn.When I'm not playing around with creative suite or paints you can usually find me in a coffee shop or adventuring outdoors. </p>
